# wg-mac join protocol — design v0

Tailscale-style onboarding for the wgctl/wg_core stack:

```
curl -sSL https://join.example/install | sudo bash -s -- --token=...
```

After ~10 s the device is online in the mesh, with a wg IP, a `wgc0`
interface managed by launchd, and a peer list that combines LAN-direct
neighbors and a hub-routed fallback for cross-network peers.

This doc nails down: the HTTP contract the Go control server must
implement, the IP plan, the hybrid routing algorithm, and the client
state machine.

---

## 1. IP plan

Single shared /16, sliced by network "site":

```
10.88.0.0/16   mesh
   10.88.0.0/24   hub site   — control plane runs here; one IP per
                              hub instance (10.88.0.1 = primary hub)
   10.88.<S>.0/24  site S    — per-LAN allocation
                              S ∈ [1, 254]; assigned by server
   device IP      10.88.<S>.<D>/32   D ∈ [2, 254]
```

A "site" = a LAN (one NAT'd public IP, one /24 of LAN IPs). The server
groups devices into sites either by:

- **explicit** `site_id` in the register payload (if the operator labels),
- or **auto**: hash of `{public_ip, lan_cidr}` reported by the device.

Hub itself is a peer in every device's [Peer] list, used for cross-site
forwarding (see §5).

---

## 2. HTTP API

All requests are JSON over HTTPS. Server URL is baked into install.sh
at hosting time, so the client doesn't need a discovery step.

### First-register-wins hub election (v0.2)

Convention: **the first device to call `/v1/register` against a fresh
control plane becomes the hub** ("老大哥"). The server, on seeing an
empty `wg_hub` row at registration time:

1. Allocates that device `device_ip = 10.88.0.1/32`, `site_id = "hub"`.
2. Populates `wg_hub.pubkey` + `wg_hub.endpoint` from the device's
   submitted `pubkey` + observed source `host:wg_listen`.
3. Returns the response with `role: "hub"` (new field, see below).
4. From then on, this device's pubkey IS the hub.

Subsequent `/v1/register` calls see a populated `wg_hub`, follow the
normal device path, and the hub appears as a [Peer] in their conf.

Failure modes:
- Hub deregisters via `/v1/leave` → control plane MUST also clear
  `wg_hub` so the next register reclaims the role.
- Hub goes silent for `> hub_takeover_sec` (config, default 24 h with
  no heartbeat) → server may flag for manual takeover; not automatic
  (avoid split-brain).

Client implications (handled by install.sh / wgctl):
- After register, branch on `role`:
  - `role == "hub"`: render conf with `Address = 10.88.0.1/24`, no
    initial [Peer] list, enable `net.inet.ip.forwarding=1`, install a
    poll-hub-peers agent that rewrites the conf from `/v1/hub/peers`.
  - `role == "device"` (default): render conf with hub peer + LAN
    peers as in §5.

### POST /v1/register

First-time join. Token is consumed (or rotated, depending on policy).

Request:
```json
{
  "token":     "k7w-zX9p-q…",        // platform-issued
  "pubkey":    "TqbeoU9mc…=",         // wg public key (base64)
  "hostname":  "yarshure-mac",        // for human display
  "os":        "darwin",
  "arch":      "arm64",
  "agent_ver": "wg-mac-20260517-e360fd07",
  "lan_addrs": [                      // for site detection + LAN reach
    {"iface": "en0",  "cidr": "192.168.11.79/24"},
    {"iface": "en10", "cidr": "10.0.0.42/24"}
  ],
  "wg_listen": 51820                  // UDP port wg_core listens on
}
```

Response 200:
```json
{
  "device_id":   "dev_a8f3…",         // opaque, returned on subsequent calls
  "device_ip":   "10.88.5.7",         // assigned wg IP
  "site_id":     "site_5",
  "role":        "device",            // "hub" iff this caller is the
                                       // first registered ever (see
                                       // §2 "first-register-wins hub")
  "mesh_cidr":   "10.88.0.0/16",
  "hub": {
    "pubkey":    "DwyGEhX…=",
    "endpoint":  "vpn.example.net:1632",   // public DDNS / static IP
    "wg_ip":     "10.88.0.1"
  },
  "peers": [                          // per-device tailored list, see §5
    {
      "pubkey":   "1isIQrxH…=",
      "wg_ip":    "10.88.5.3",
      "endpoint": "192.168.11.79:51820",   // LAN-direct
      "site_id":  "site_5",
      "hostname": "yarshure-dev"
    },
    {
      "pubkey":   "DwyGEhX…=",
      "endpoint": "vpn.example.net:1632",  // hub
      "site_id":  "hub",
      "allowed_extra": [                   // cross-site subnets routed via hub
        "10.88.0.0/24",
        "10.88.7.0/24"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "keepalive_sec": 25,
  "refresh_sec":   300                // next /v1/peers poll interval
}
```

Errors:
- `401 invalid_token`
- `409 pubkey_already_registered` (idempotent retry with same token + pubkey returns 200)
- `429 token_exhausted`
- `500` with `{"error": "…"}` body

### GET /v1/peers

Polled periodically by client to refresh peer list (new joins, IP
rotations, removed devices). Auth via `Authorization: Bearer <token>` AND
`X-Device-Id: <device_id>` returned at register.

Response 200 (same peer shape as /register):
```json
{
  "device_ip":    "10.88.5.7",        // unchanged unless rotated
  "peers":        [...],
  "hub":          {...},
  "keepalive_sec": 25,
  "refresh_sec":   300,
  "rev":          "etag-or-monotonic",     // change cursor (see Long-poll below)
  "token_expires": "2026-06-17T00:00:00Z"  // null if non-expiring
}
```

The server is the source of truth — the client overwrites its conf with
each refresh.

> **`rev` is required for long-poll and is currently MISSING from
> `/v1/peers` on the live control plane.** The server team must add a
> top-level `rev` computed identically to `/v1/hub/peers` (opaque
> etag-or-monotonic over the device's effective peer view). Until it
> ships, the agent never sees a cursor and stays in plain-poll mode — no
> regression. See **Long-poll (v2)** below.

#### Long-poll (v2)

`GET /v1/peers?wait=<sec>&rev=<last_rev>` lets the agent hold the request
open until the peer set changes, cutting propagation from ~60 s to
sub-second. Three response cases the server must implement:

- **Changed** (or no `rev` sent): `200` with the full body above (new `rev`).
- **Unchanged after holding `wait` sec**: `200 {"not_modified": true, "rev": "<current>"}`
  (no peer body). This is also the agent's signal that long-poll is supported.
- **Legacy / unsupported**: ignore `?wait`/`?rev`, return the full body
  immediately (today's behavior).

Rules: `wait` is server-clamped (e.g. ≤60 s); `rev` is opaque to the
client (stored + echoed only) and should be scoped to the device's own
view so an unrelated site's change doesn't wake every device. The agent
auto-detects support (a held connection or a `not_modified` reply) and
degrades to plain polling otherwise. Same `?wait`/`?rev`/`not_modified`
contract applies to `/v1/hub/peers`.

### POST /v1/heartbeat

Optional lightweight liveness signal. Server uses this to mark "online"
vs "stale" devices.

Request:
```json
{
  "device_id":   "dev_a8f3…",
  "lan_addrs":   [...],                // detect roam
  "wg_endpoint": "1.2.3.4:51820",      // public observed peer
  "stats": {                           // optional
    "rx_bytes": 1234567,
    "tx_bytes": 9876543,
    "last_handshake_sec": 42
  }
}
```

Response 200, no body. Drives the server-side "is device alive" view.

### POST /v1/leave

Voluntary deregister. Server marks device removed; subsequent /v1/peers
on remaining devices will no longer include it.

```json
{ "device_id": "dev_a8f3…", "token": "…" }
```

### POST /v1/token/refresh

For rotating tokens (platform-managed). Client sends current token, gets
back a new one. Old token invalidated immediately.

```json
{ "device_id": "dev_a8f3…", "token": "<current>" }
→ { "token": "<new>", "expires": "2026-06-17T00:00:00Z" }
```

If client misses the rotation window (old token has expired), it must
re-register with a fresh platform-issued token — exactly the same as a
fresh install.

### GET /v1/hub/peers

Hub-only endpoint, called by the hub's periodic agent to refresh its
own `[Peer]` list. Auth via `Authorization: Bearer <hub-token>` AND
`X-Device-Id: <hub-device-id>` returned from /v1/register when the
caller was elected hub.

Server validates the caller is the current hub (matches `wg_hub.pubkey`
implicitly via device_id), then returns ALL active devices flattened:

```json
{
  "peers": [
    { "pubkey": "TqbeoU…", "wg_ip": "10.88.1.2/32", "hostname": "yarshure-mac" },
    { "pubkey": "9yRYL…",  "wg_ip": "10.88.1.3/32", "hostname": "another-mac" },
    ...
  ],
  "rev":          "etag-or-monotonic",   // for change detection
  "refresh_sec":  30
}
```

Hub agent uses `rev` to skip rewrite when unchanged. On change:
overwrite `/etc/wireguard/<hub-iface>.conf` with the new peer list and
`launchctl kickstart -k system/com.wireguard.wg-mac.<hub-iface>`.

Supports the same long-poll contract as `/v1/peers`:
`GET /v1/hub/peers?wait=<sec>&rev=<last_rev>` → full list (new `rev`) on
change, `200 {"not_modified": true, "rev": "<current>"}` after holding
`wait` sec unchanged, or immediate full list on a legacy server. `rev`
already exists here, so only the `?wait`/`?rev` hold + `not_modified`
reply need adding server-side.

### GET /v1/install (or /install.sh)

Static endpoint serving the install.sh script. Operator can rotate the
embedded server URL by re-uploading.

### GET /v1/bundle (or /bundle.tar.gz)

Static endpoint serving the latest wg-mac tarball. Install.sh fetches
this. Server returns `Content-Type: application/gzip` and ideally
`Content-Length` so the client can verify.

---

## 3. Token lifecycle (platform-managed)

Server tracks each token's lifecycle:

```
issued ──┐
         │  POST /v1/register
         ▼
       bound to device  ──┐
         │                │  POST /v1/token/refresh
         │                ▼
         │              rotated ─┐
         │                       │  POST /v1/leave  OR
         │                       │  POST /v1/token/refresh ...
         │                       ▼
         └─────────► expired / revoked
```

- A fresh device join requires a token in state "issued".
- After successful /register, the token is bound to {device_id, pubkey}.
  Re-using the same token on a different device → 401.
- Periodic refresh: client calls /v1/token/refresh well before
  `token_expires`. Suggested 80% of TTL.
- If refresh fails (revoked / expired): wg_core keeps running, client
  marks state `degraded`, retries every 5 min. Operator must re-issue
  a token out-of-band (e.g. SSO portal).

This matches your "可能定期刷新" requirement.

---

## 4. Client state on disk

```
/etc/wgctl/
  config.json                       chmod 0600
    {
      "server":     "https://join.example",
      "device_id":  "dev_a8f3…",
      "token":      "…",
      "token_expires": "2026-06-17T00:00:00Z",
      "wg_ip":      "10.88.5.7",
      "site_id":    "site_5",
      "last_refresh": "2026-05-17T03:42:00Z"
    }

/etc/wireguard/wgc0.conf             rendered from /v1/peers response
                                     (replaces hand-written wg0.conf
                                     in the join-flow path)

/var/log/wgctl-agent.log             refresh + heartbeat events
```

The wg secret (PrivateKey) stays in `/etc/wireguard/wgc0.conf` and is
generated by `wgctl genkey` once on first install. It is never sent to
the server — only the corresponding public key is.

---

## 5. Hybrid peer-list computation (server side)

Given device D in site S, the server emits:

```
peers(D) = LAN_peers(S) + [hub]
```

Where:

- **LAN_peers(S)** = all alive devices in site S except D.
  Each entry has the peer's LAN-direct endpoint (its reported
  `lan_addrs` + `wg_listen`) and AllowedIPs = `<peer_wg_ip>/32`.

- **hub** entry: the central forwarder.
  - `endpoint`: public DDNS or static IP of the hub.
  - `allowed_extra`: union of all `10.88.<S'>.0/24` for S' ≠ S, plus
    `10.88.0.0/24` (the hub's own subnet, so hub services are reachable).

Client renders /etc/wireguard/wgc0.conf as:

```ini
[Interface]
PrivateKey = <local>
Address    = 10.88.5.7/32
ListenPort = 51820

# LAN peer 1
[Peer]
PublicKey  = 1isIQrxH…=
Endpoint   = 192.168.11.79:51820
AllowedIPs = 10.88.5.3/32
PersistentKeepalive = 25

# … more LAN peers …

# hub (cross-site forwarder)
[Peer]
PublicKey  = DwyGEhX…=
Endpoint   = vpn.example.net:1632
AllowedIPs = 10.88.0.0/24, 10.88.7.0/24, 10.88.9.0/24
PersistentKeepalive = 25
```

Routing on D:
- Packet to 10.88.5.3 → wg cryptokey routing hits LAN peer 1 entry → direct.
- Packet to 10.88.7.42 → matches hub's AllowedIPs `10.88.7.0/24` → encrypted to hub → hub IP-forwards within its own AllowedIPs trie to the actual device.

Hub requirements:
- `net.inet.ip.forwarding=1`
- Its own [Peer] list contains every device, each with AllowedIPs =
  `<device_wg_ip>/32`. (Hub gets the union from the same API.)
- NAT optional: needed only if mesh devices also want internet egress
  via hub. Pure mesh-internal traffic needs forwarding only.

A device entering or leaving site S triggers a peer-list refresh on
every other device in S, and on the hub. Strategy: the agent holds a
**long-poll** `GET /v1/peers?wait=…&rev=…` (single mesh iface; ~55 s
budget per launchd invocation, then relaunched) so a change propagates
sub-second once the server supports it (see **Long-poll (v2)** under
`/v1/peers`). The agent auto-detects support and falls back to plain
polling every `refresh_sec` against a server that doesn't — so this is
safe to ship client-side ahead of the server. **Server-side TODO**:
honor `?wait`/`?rev`, return `{"not_modified":true,"rev":…}` on timeout,
and add the missing `rev` to `/v1/peers`.

## 7. wgctl agent (periodic refresh)

A small daemon, or a launchd-scheduled `wgctl refresh` command:

```bash
# /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.wireguard.wgctl-agent.plist
# Runs every refresh_sec; rewrites /etc/wireguard/wgc0.conf if peer list
# changed; kickstarts wg_core to pick up new config.

wgctl refresh
```

`wgctl refresh` behavior:
1. Read /etc/wgctl/config.json
2. If token expires within 24 h → POST /v1/token/refresh
3. GET /v1/peers (with Bearer token)
4. Compare returned peer set against current /etc/wireguard/wgc0.conf
5. If changed: rewrite conf, kickstart launchd, log to
   /var/log/wgctl-agent.log
6. POST /v1/heartbeat with stats from `wgctl show wgc0`

This is the second wgctl subcommand to add — small, ~150 lines C, or
move to a Go agent if the team prefers.

## 8. Open items

| Item | Suggestion | Why |
|------|-----------|-----|
| Bundle signing | minisign or cosign signature alongside tar.gz; install.sh verifies before running | curl-pipe-bash is fine for trusted server but signing closes MITM gap |
| Server TLS | LetsEncrypt + DDNS on the public hub | bearer tokens over plaintext = bad |
| ipv6 in mesh | mesh_cidr += `fd88::/32`; device gets `/128` | matches tailscale conventions |
| Magic DNS | hub runs DNS at 10.88.0.1, hostnames → wg_ip | optional, post-v1 |
| NAT traversal for two devices both behind NAT | DERP-style relay, or coturn | hybrid topology already routes those through hub today, so v1 doesn't need it |
| wgctl_max_peers | bump from 8 to 64 (currently `#define WG_MAX_PEERS 8` in wg_core.c) | mesh growth |
| Token rotation jitter | server staggers refresh_sec per device | avoids thundering herd |

## 9. Implementation order suggested

### v0.1 (initial, partly done)
1. (Go) Stand up minimal control server: `/v1/register`, `/v1/peers`,
   `/v1/install`, `/v1/bundle`. Stub `/v1/heartbeat` + `/v1/token/refresh`. ✓
2. (C, wg_core) Bump `WG_MAX_PEERS` from 8 to 64. ✓
3. (Shell) Write `install.sh` per §6, hosted at `<server>/v1/install`. ✓
4. (Nginx) Expose `/v1/*` to public — currently dock-only, route not
   yet proxied. Pending.
5. (Go) Site allocator: normalize `firstLANCIDR` to network address so
   devices on the same /24 get the same site. Currently uses raw device
   CIDR which produces a site-per-device. Pending.

### v0.2 (first-register-wins hub election — *current branch*)
6. (Go) On `/v1/register` with empty `wg_hub`: assign caller `role=hub`,
   `device_ip=10.88.0.1`, populate `wg_hub.pubkey/endpoint` from caller's
   pubkey + observed `source_ip:wg_listen`. Pending.
7. (Go) New `/v1/hub/peers` endpoint per §2. Pending.
8. (Go) `/v1/leave` for hub also clears `wg_hub` so the next caller
   reclaims the role. Pending.
9. (Shell) `install.sh` branches on `role`:
    - hub: render conf at 10.88.0.1/24, enable IP forwarding, install
      hub-agent.plist.
    - device: existing behavior. Pending after server changes land.
10. (C, wgctl) New `wgctl hub-refresh` subcommand (mac side): polls
    `/v1/hub/peers`, rewrites hub iface conf, kickstarts. Pending.
11. (Plist) `com.wireguard.wgctl-hub-agent.plist` runs `wgctl hub-refresh`
    every `refresh_sec`. Pending.

### v0.3 (post-hub)
12. (C, wgctl) `wgctl refresh` for device-side peer-list sync (§7).
13. (Plist) `com.wireguard.wgctl-agent.plist` for device-side refresh.
14. (Go) Heartbeat ingestion + alive/stale tracking.
15. (Go) Cross-site hub `allowed_extra` computation per §5.

The Mac side (4 + 9 + 10 + 12 in wgctl/install.sh) waits on the Go side
items above before it can integrate. Until then, manual hub conf on the
first device, and clients fall back to "no hub, LAN-direct only" mode.
